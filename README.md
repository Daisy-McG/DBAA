## Testing

## Known Bugs

Validation fails on pages that CK editor is used for the rich text formatting, it is coming from the rendered html code within which we have no control over.

Avatar does not load on the users profile while looking at the allauth change password card on that page.

### Test Results

## Deployment

### Project Creation
To create this project I used the `git init` command in the terminal from VS Code.

I then used the `git add .` command followed by `git commit -m "Initial commit"` and was then prompted to create a new repository 
with the choices of public or private.

The following commands were used for version control throughout the project:

`git add <filename>` - This command was used to add files to the staging area before committing.

`git commit -m "commit message explaining the updates"` - This command was used to to commit changes to the local repository.

`git push` - This command is used to push all committed changes to the GitHub repository.
